TWRP_THEME_PORTER
==================

Informal Update: I have been seeing on XDA and AF that I was mysteriously banished with no explanation. Seems my Port script has taken a big hit so I wanted to inform you all that I willingly chose to leave XDA and AF so that I may be with family more often than not. Thanks for understanding.

With the above stated, twrp has undergone some recent updates. TWRP now supports more than one xml document. My script will only target the ui.xml file. If a themer uses any hardcoded values in the other xml file then you will be required to manually port those values - at least until this script is updated to accomondate for more than one xml file.

Please, should you have the time and decide to adjust the codes then I insist you send it my way for review and so I may even possibly merge to my repo. Thanks!

-- Happy Hunting!!
