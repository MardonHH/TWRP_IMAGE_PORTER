# Requires Busybox, and GraphicsMagick (gm)!

The gm binary in my repo is cross compiled for ARM devices. If someone wishes to compile gm for MIPS or x86, please share with me so I may include it to my repo. I only have an ARM based device so there is no point in me compiling gm for MIPS or x86 since I have no way to test and confirm that they work.

This script will port images from one device resolution to another device resolution using accurate calculations.

This script is initially designed for porting TWRP Images across other device resolutions, but will not handle the ui.xml file.

Porting images manually goes as follows:

720/96=7.5
480/7.5=64
From 720 width to 480 width you would change 96 to 64 for an accurate port.

All fractions on the final value are to be rounded up or down appropriately.

Greater than five goes up and Lesser than five goes down to the nearest integer.

The script will automatically handle all of this.
